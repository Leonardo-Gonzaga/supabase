## Installation

<BlockItem name="social-auth-nextjs" description="All needed components for the social auth flow" />

## Folder structure

This block includes the [Supabase client](/ui/docs/tanstack/client). When installing, you can skip overwriting it.

<RegistryBlock itemName="social-auth-tanstack" />

## Usage

Once you install the block in your Tanstack Start project, you'll get all the necessary pages and components to set up a social authentication flow.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).

### Setting up third party providers

We support a wide variety of social providers that you can use to integrate with your application. The full list is available [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login).
The block is using PKCE flow and Github as a provider, but you could easily change it by changing the `provider` field in `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth` call.

### Setting up routes and redirect URLs

1. Set the site URL in the [URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings in the Supabase Dashboard.
1. Update the redirect paths in the `login-form.tsx` components to point to the logged-in routes in your app.

### Combining social auth with password-based auth

If you want to combine this block with the password-based auth, you need to:

- Copy the `handleSocialLogin` function into the password-based `login-form.tsx` component and bind it to a button.
- Copy the `@/routes/auth/oauth.ts` in your app under the same route.
