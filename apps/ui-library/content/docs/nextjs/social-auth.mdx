## Installation

<BlockItem name="social-auth-nextjs" description="All needed components for the social auth flow" />

## Folder structure

This block includes the [Supabase client](/ui/docs/nextjs/client). When installing, you can skip overwriting it.

<RegistryBlock itemName="password-based-auth-nextjs" />

## Usage

Once you install the block in your Next.js project, you'll get all the necessary pages and components to set up a social authentication flow.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).

### Setting up third party providers

We support a wide variety of social providers that you can use to integrate with your application. The full list is available [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login).

### Setting up routes and redirect URLs

1. Set the site URL in the [URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings in the Supabase Dashboard.
1. Set up the Next.js route that users will visit to reset or update their password. Go to the [URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings and add the `forgot-password` route to the list of Redirect URLs. It should look something like: `http://example.com/auth/forgot-password`.

1. Update the redirect paths in the `login-form.tsx` and `update-password-form.tsx` components to point to the logged-in routes in your app.

You can use this block with the Pages router by simply moving the routes from the `app` folder into the `pages` folder and renaming them. Example instead of `app/login/page.tsx`, you'd create a `pages/login.tsx` file.
